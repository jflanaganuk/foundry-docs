# Currency & Items

### Linking items in chat

 - To link items in the chat of FoundryVTT click the item on your character sheet in DnDBeyond
 - A side bar should open up, this will also contain more information about your item
 - Clicking the "Display in VTT" link in the top right will place the description in the FoundryVTT chat
 - This is useful for showing the DM what your item does

### Editing currency

There has often been confusion in the past as to where you should actually edit your currency.

It should now always be changed in DnDBeyond **only** inside your equipment tab!
