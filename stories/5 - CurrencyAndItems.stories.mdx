# Currency & Items

## Linking items in chat

 - To link items in the chat of FoundryVTT click the item on your character sheet in DnDBeyond

<img src={Item}/>

 - A side bar should open up, this will also contain more information about your item

<img src={ItemSidebar}/>

 - Clicking the "Display in VTT" link in the top right will place the description in the FoundryVTT chat

<img src={ItemFoundry}/>

 - This is useful for showing the DM what your item does

## Editing currency

There has often been confusion in the past as to where you should actually edit your currency.

It should now always be changed in DnDBeyond **only** inside your equipment tab!
