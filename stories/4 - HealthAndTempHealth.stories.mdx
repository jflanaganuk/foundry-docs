# Health

## Changing health and temp health

 - Beyond20 now allows you to sync your character's health in FoundryVTT with DnDBeyond
 - If you followed the install steps above this should already be working for you
 - Simply change your character's health in DnDBeyond and your token should update accordingly

 - This also works with temp health (remember to minus from this pool first when you take damage)

<img src={HealthTemp} />

 - It should also work for pets as long as you edit the health from your "Extras" tab

 - If you are unfortunate and end up in death saving throw mode, use the DnDBeyond interface to resolve them on your turns
