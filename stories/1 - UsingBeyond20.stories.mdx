# Using Beyond20 with FoundryVTT

### Installing

 - Install Beyond20 for [**Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beyond-20/gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh) or [**Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/beyond-20/)

Beyond20 makes it easy to use your DnDBeyond character inside of FoundryVTT without the need to import and manage your character in two places.

Here is an example of it in action:

### Connecting to Foundry

 - Simply open up [**Foundry**](https://www.uploadr.co.uk:30000/join) and log in to your character
 - Next, click the Beyond20 extension in the top right of your browser
 - Thats it! You can now proceed to connecting to DnDBeyond

### Connecting to DnDBeyond

 - In another tab open up [**DnDBeyond**](https://ddb.ac) and navigate to your character
 - You may get a warning about opening up "Features and Traits" if this is the first time using your character
    - Simply opening that tab like Beyond20 is asking will fix the issue

 - Now you should be able to click your character sheet in DnDBeyond and your rolls will appear in Foundry!
