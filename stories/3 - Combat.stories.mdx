# Combat

### Attacking with Weapons Spells and Abilities

## To attack with a weapon
 - Make sure you have the weapon equipped and go to the actions tab
 - Click the Hit/DC column to roll for Hit

 - If you hit you can either click "Roll Damage" in FoundryVTT or click the Damage column in DnDBeyond
    - Note that if you click in FoundryVTT nothing will happen in DnDBeyond

 - If you miss, unlucky, try next time!
 - **Don't forget to reduce any ammo you may have used!**

## To attack with a spell
 - Click the spells tab in DnDBeyond
 - Click "Cast" and the spell will appear in FoundryVTT

<img src={SpellCastFoundry}/>

 - If the spell requires a template (eg. it fires in a cone) use the templates tool
    - Then select the tool you require

<img src={TemplateTool}/>

   - And place it on the map

<img src={TemplateToolUsed}/>

 - **Don't forget to click the spell slot level that you have used!**

## To use an ability

 - Some actions - such as barbarian's rage or paladin's lay on hands - do not count as weapons or spells
 - To use these simply declare in game that you are using that ability and click the text on your character sheet

<img src={AbilityExample}/>

 - This opens up a side bar that allows you to click "Beyond20" and send it across to FoundryVTT's chat

<img src={AbilitySidebar}/>
<img src={AbilitySidebarFoundry}/>

 - Then mark in DnDBeyond that you have used this ability if it is limited use

<img src={AbilityExampleMarked}/>

 - **It is up to you to keep track of the abilities that you use in combat if required**

## Applying conditions

 - Beyond20 also allows you to sync conditions that your character may endure 
 - In DnDBeyond if you click the "conditions" area of your sheet a side bar should open

<img src={Conditions}/>

 - This allows you to toggle any conditions your character has (eg. going prone or being poisoned)

<img src={ConditionsSidebar}/>
<img src={ConditionsSidebarSelected}/>

 - You should see your character update in FoundryVTT and the correct icon be applied to the token

<img src={ConditionsFoundryIcon}/>

 - A chat message is also displayed

<img src={ConditionsFoundry}/>
