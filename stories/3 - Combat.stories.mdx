# Combat

### Attacking with Weapons Spells and Abilities

To attack with a weapon
 - Make sure you have the weapon equipped and go to the actions tab
 - Click the Hit/DC column to roll for Hit
 - If you hit you can either click "Roll Damage" in FoundryVTT or click the Damage column in DnDBeyond
    - Note that if you click in FoundryVTT nothing will happen in DnDBeyond
 - If you miss, unlucky, try next time!
 - **Don't forget to reduce any ammo you may have used!**

To attack with a spell
 - Click the spells tab in DnDBeyond
 - Click "Cast" and the spell will appear in FoundryVTT
 - If the spell requires a template (eg. it fires in a cone) use the templates tool
    - Then select the tool you require
    - And place it on the map
 - **Don't forget to click the spell slot level that you have used!**

To use an ability

 - Some actions - such as barbarian's rage or paladin's lay on hands - do not count as weapons or spells
 - To use these simply declare in game that you are using that ability and click the text on your character sheet
 - This opens up a side bar that allows you to click "Beyond20" and send it across to FoundryVTT's chat
 - Then mark in DnDBeyond that you have used this ability if it is limited use
 - **It is up to you to keep track of the abilities that you use in combat**

### Applying conditions

 - Beyond20 also allows you to sync conditions that your character may endure 
 - In DnDBeyond if you click the "conditions" area of your sheet a side bar should open
 - This allows you to toggle any conditions your character has (eg. going prone or being poisoned)
 - You should see your character update in FoundryVTT and the correct icon be applied to the token
 - A chat message is also displayed
