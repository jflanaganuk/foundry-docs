# Using chat in FoundryVTT

## Whispering to the DM

To whisper to the DM type:

```
/w GM <your message>
```

A whisper should appear as:

<img src={Whisper}/>

## Whispering to other players

To whisper to other players:

```
/w [<the player you want to whisper too>] <your message>
```

eg. to whisper to "John Smith" that he smells type:

```
/w [john smith] you smell
```

## Tip: Easier Whispering

After you type

```
/w
```

and hit `<space>` an auto complete box will popup.

<img src={WhisperDropdown}/>

You can then start typing the player's name and hit `<tab>` to autocomplete the prompt.

It should appear as:

```
/w [player's name]
```
