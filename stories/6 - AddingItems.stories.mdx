# Adding Items

## Adding a standard item

 - To add an item to your character click equipment
 - Then click "manage equipment"

<img src={ManageEquipment}/>

 - A side bar should open up and a search box appears

<img src={AddItemSidebar}/>

 - Search for the item you require and click "add"

<img src={AddItemSidebarAdd}/>

 - **Be careful to add the correct rarity of your item, in some cases there can be multiple**
    - Black text is the common variant of the item
    - Green is an uncommon magical variant
    - Blue is a rare magical variant
    - Purple is an epic magical variant
    - Orange are legendary

## Adding a custom item

 - If the item you want to add does not exist you should still add it to your character sheet!
 - **Custom items can arguably be MORE important than regular items as they literally exist specfically for the campaign you are playing!!!**
 - To add a custom item click equipment

<img src={ManageEquipment}/>

 - A side bar should open up with the search box

<img src={AddItemSidebar}/>

 - However, this time click "Custom items" and open it up
 - Any custom items you have previously made will be here, otherwise it may be blank

<img src={AddItemSidebarCustom}/>

 - Click "+ Add Custom Item"
 - An "Unidentified Item" is made automatically

<img src={AddItemSidebarCustomUnidentified}/>

 - This obviously isn't any good, so click on the item that was just made
 - The side bar will change to an item view, click "Edit" near the top

<img src={AddItemSidebarCustomUnidentifiedOpen}/>

 - You can now edit the name of the item to match what it is that you have found
 - You can add a description to remind you and the DM where this item was located and what you currently know about it
    - **Don't** skip this part!
