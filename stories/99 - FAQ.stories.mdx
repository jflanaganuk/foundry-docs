## Frequently Asked Questions

##### What do I do with my foundry character sheet now?
###### You should be able to just ignore it

##### Really?
###### Yes

##### I've cast a spell or used an ability in Foundry and it didn't update DnDBeyond?
###### The sync works the opposite way, roll again but in DnDBeyond

##### I've changed my health in Foundry, but DnDBeyond didn't update?
###### The sync works the opposite way, change your health in DnDBeyond

##### So is FoundryVTT literally just used for moving your token around?
###### Yes, pretty much

##### But I liked the old way, can't we go back?
###### It caused too many problems with adding items, syncing characters correctly and other jankiness that I could list forever. Plus, falling back to DnDBeyond proper prepares us better for when we eventually go back to playing DnD in person once again. Also, if we ever change VTTs we don't have to relearn it all again

##### Who's checking we don't just cheat and add stuff we don't have or not remove items we have used?
###### No one is, "with great power comes great responsibility" etc. etc.

##### Can I tell on my fellow player who I know for a fact is fudging their character sheet?
###### No one likes a snitch

###### (But yes, tell me)

##### I have noticed that my character sheet in Foundry has stopped matching my character sheet in DnDBeyond?
###### Stop looking at the character sheet in Foundry!

###### In all seriousness, as long as your sheet is correct in DnDBeyond, it should not matter what your sheet says in Foundry

##### Then why have you kept the character sheet in Foundry?
###### I need it for other, DM related, non-nefarious reasons.

##### I've noticed that there are four buttons that appear on the chat window when we do damage, what are they for?
###### They're for me, don't touch them

##### It sounds like you're being shirty with me?
###### Im not, promise

##### I've noticed that I can roll for other players if I have their character sheet open?
###### Yeah... this is a thing... there is not much I can do about it because the addon in foundry uses one api key for DnDBeyond, which is currently set to mine as I have control over everyone's character as the DM

###### So basically, yeah, please don't do this

##### I've done a normal roll that went through but realised you said roll advantage/disadvantage?
###### Roll a normal roll again and we shall use the lower/higher number

###### Don't just roll again as advantage/disadvantage please

##### I've got another question that wasn't listed here?
###### Ping me on slack and I'll add it :)
