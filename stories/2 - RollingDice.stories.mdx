# Rolling Dice

## Rolling to make an ability check

 - Simply click along the top for the main 6 abilities to roll them when asked

<img src={AbilityCheck}/>

 - If asked instead to make a "saving throw" click the abilities to the top left of your sheet

<img src={SavingThrow}/>

 - For more specific ability checks, they are towards the centre

<img src={AdditionalCheck}/>

## Rolling with advantage and disadvantage

<img src={Normal}/>

 - For advantage, simply hold down "shift" before hovering over your desired roll, the icon will change to a green die with a plus on it
 
<img src={Advantage}/>

 - For disadvantage, hold down "ctrl" before hovering over your desired roll, the icon will change to a red die with a minus on it

<img src={Disadvantage}/>

## Rolling for initiative

 - Simply click the initiative on your DnDBeyond character sheet
 - Do not do this before your DM has told you to go as they have to make sure the combat tracker is listening for rolls
 - NOTE: You must have your character selected in FoundryVTT

<img src={Initiative}/>

## Bonus: Making your rolls appear in DnDBeyond once again

You may have noticed that doing the above stops your rolls appearing in DnDBeyond, to fix this:

 - Navigate to the tab containing Foundry or your DnDBeyond Character
 - Open up the extension by clicking the Beyond20 icon in the top right of your browser
 - Click the option called "Use D&D Beyond's digital dice"

<img src={UseDnDBeyond}/>

## Public, Private and Blind rolls

Beyond20 will respect what ever you set the rolls dropdown to in FoundryVTT.

A quick breakdown of each roll type:
 - Public, everyone at the table will see your roll
 - Private, only you and the DM will see your roll
 - Blind, only the DM will see your roll
 - Self, only you will see your roll (useful for testing)

<img src={RollType}/>

## Generic Rolling

Occasionally you may be asked to roll dice that do not correspond to a weapon/spell or ability.

 - To do this, click the icon in the bottom left of your DnDBeyond Character sheet

<img src={GenericIcon}/>

 - Here you can queue up the amount of dice you want to roll and what type

<img src={GenericRoll}/>

 - After rolling, the results will appear inside FoundryVTT like usual
